After, I made the circuit, and started looking for the Bluetooth code on the app's link list. However I couldn't find it.

At first, I thought I had made an error in my arduino code, or in the circuit wiring, but after some searching I could find another problem. The Bluetooth mocule I purchase, HM-10, doesn't support a basic Bluetooth link. So I had to purchase an HC-06 Bluetooth module, which supports a basic Bluetooth link. From this experience, I realized importance researching commonly usedcomponent, and characteristics of parts I purchase.
